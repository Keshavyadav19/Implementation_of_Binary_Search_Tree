# Implementation_of_Binary_Search_Tree
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of binary tree where each node has a key, and every node's key is greater than the keys in its left subtree and smaller than the keys in its right subtree. This property makes BSTs useful for various operations, including searching, insertion, and deletion, all of which can be performed efficiently.
